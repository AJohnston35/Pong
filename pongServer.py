# Purpose: This program acts as the server with which the two clients use to communicate between each other

# Use this file to write your server logic
# You will need to support at least two clients
# You will need to keep track of where on the screen (x,y coordinates) each paddle is, the score 
# for each player and where the ball is, and relay that to each client
# I suggest you use the sync variable in pongClient.py to determine how out of sync your two
# clients are and take actions to resync the games


# The server needs to communicate with two clients simultaneously 
# over a network using sockets.  It will need to use threads to handle 
# the two simultaneous clients.  It is responsible for relaying the location 
# of the other playerâ€™s paddle to the client, the location of the ball and the current score.

# Purpose: The purpose of this class is to contain all the functions needed to connect to the clients and share
#          information between the two so the game can be played from different clients
# Preconditions: The class is intialized when the program is started
# Postconditions: When all the functions in the thread class are done running the game should be over

# Preconditions: This code is run when the program starts after variables have been initialized
# Postconditions: After this code has run the server should be waiting for clients to connect
